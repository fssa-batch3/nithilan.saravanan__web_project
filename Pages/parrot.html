            <h1>PARROT</h1> <br><br><br>

        </div>
        <div class="section1">
            <p>Parrots, also known as psittacines, are birds of the roughly 398 species in 92
                genera comprising the order Psittaciformes found mostly in tropical and subtropical
                regions. The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true" parrots), the
                Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are
                threatened by extinction, with higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other
                comparable bird group. Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species
                inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is
                in South America and Australasia. <br><br>

                Characteristic features of parrots include a strong, curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and
                clawed zygodactyl feet. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. Most parrots
                exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum. They form the most variably sized bird
                order in terms of length. <br><br>

                The most important components of most parrots' diets are seeds, nuts, fruit, buds, and other plant
                material. A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion, while the lories and lorikeets are
                specialised for feeding on floral nectar and soft fruits. Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows (or
                nest boxes in captivity), and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial (helpless) young. <br><br>

                Parrots, along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies, are among the most intelligent birds, and the
                ability of some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets. Trapping wild parrots
                for the pet trade, as well as hunting, habitat loss, and competition from invasive species, has
                diminished wild populations, with parrots being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of
                birds. As of 2021, about 50 million parrots (half of all parrots) live in captivity, with the vast
                majority of these living as pets in people's homes. Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some
                high-profile charismatic species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the
                same ecosystems. <br><br>

                Parrots are the only creatures that display true tripedalism, using their necks and beaks as limbs with
                propulsive forces equal to or greater than those forces generated by the forelimbs of primates when
                climbing vertical surfaces. They can travel with cyclical tripedal gaits when climbing.</p>
